# Blackburn_Rachel_Code_Louisville
[ Dated 11/18/2017 ]
During the course of the last three months I have been attending a job training workshop / class / bootcamp called Code Louisville. The training included a variety of basic techniques and knowledge into the world of web design. One of our requirements for graduation was to build a website / project to demonstrate our knowledge of these skills.

The website's concept started and will end in its finality as a resource page for dungeons and dragons players. [ DnD being a tabletop game placed with dice, paper, sometimes mini figurines and often handrawn maps. ] Our hope for it [ by saying our, there are others interested in helping continue its developement ] is that it will develope into an application strictly for phone, with versions for browsers as well where artistic ability can be combined with programming to create an immersive adventuring expirience. 

In this file you will find the beginnings of what I hope will be a grand endevour. You will see the bare bones of what I am working through. Web pages have been skeletoned into place and a few place holders alotted. Herein I shall explain them.

[**There are no special needs to open and operate this website's core text files. You must simply download the zipped folder and execute the index file in a browser in order to view the concept.**]

[ The Front Page ] is not fully operational. When all is said and done [ and I finish out other courses for learning the back end of things. ] 

The contact button will take you to a different link. Likely a form processed through google which is connected to my email. This sort of thing is absolutely imperative. As the google forms will put the data into spreadsheets automaticly which keeps commissions and requests / responses to inquiries time stamped. [ Customer Service ] The place holder image of the flying creature will be replaced by an updated / timely photo of the developer. [ Myself ]. The scrolling " blog " post style bit will be updated to function as a blog might with an exterior / interior ability to post the blog itself and have the containers generate automaticly. [ These being things that are to happen in the future. ]

[ The Portrait Maker Page ]
Initially intended for an HTML / Potentially flash based game for creating player images for Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns., this page includes a click through gallery of kittens at time this project is submitted for review by the mentors and host of the workshop I am attending. In creating this box however I discovered the potential to explore more artistic content related things. I still intend on using this page to host the game and in the future the images will reflect the progress of the game itself. But it also opens up the idea of a continuous scene [ scrolling scene ] web comic. Which in this nerdy day and age is something alot of artists do to put themselves out there. And as we all know, marketting, networking, interests are important for success.

[Dice Roller] 
At time of presentation to the hosts of the workshop this page will have been commented out of the navigation. It will however still be functioning and in progress. But a blank page only provided clutter. This page will be hosting the " dice roller " or D20 roll system that is still being developed. [ And may very well be collaborated upon with other students, coworkers or friends ]. It is intended to be a visually pleasing and digital dice rolling application that can be loaded via phone or web in the middle of a game. Don't have dice? No Problem!

[ Backstory Generator ]
This page is one of the more difficult ones. In the making of the current generator that is holding the place of the backstory. I discovered my weakness. I am able but not adept at the date this commit is made to finagle javascript into place. But I want it to do so much more than simply spit out the text at random intervals. So getting the javascript to generate based on a random set of variables to produce yet another random set of variables based on the previous will be a journey. At the current state, this generator is a display of the ability to create a string of variables to produce a little bit of dry humor. In the future, the same concept will be used to display backstories for characters to give a little bit more depth and aid to the quick start of dungeon campaigns that are notorious for taking days to write sheets up for.


 Future Developement 
 - Backstory Generator [ In Progress - Short Term Goal] *Give players the ability to have more depth to characters and get to the fun quicker*
 - Dice Roller [ Commented Out - Concept Review ] *Give players the ability to roll dice virtually*
 - Portrait Maker [In Review / In Progress ] *To provide players with artwork to help them have an immersive expierience*
 - Blog Style Update Posts [ Concept in Review ] *To Alert those interested in the developement to our progress*
 - Scrolling Adventure Style Comic [ Concept in Review ] *A comic about an adventuring group in a campaign and their misadventures*
 - Loot Store [ Concept in Review ] *Items that could be purchased with logo / design when it comes about*
 - Online DnD Chat Site [ Project In Review - Long Term Goal ] *A web application where people can host / save campaign progress with images of walls , maps, characters and monsters available*
