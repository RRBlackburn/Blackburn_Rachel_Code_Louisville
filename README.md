# Blackburn_Rachel_Code_Louisville
A class project.
 This Class Project is a work in progress. It is meant to be a gaming resource site.
 I am adding a color picker, a backstory generator, and a variety of small trinkety applications based in HTML5.
 I am facing issues at the moment with my text overflowing the boxes on the timeline.
 I have yet to add the media querries for the middle stage as well as the movement of the right column to the bottom when smaller.
 
 Future Developement 
 - Color Picker
 - Backstory Generator
 - Dice Roller
 - Portrait Maker [ Personal Art Project ]
 - Commission Submission Form [ For Custom Character Graphics ]
 - Online DnD Chat Site [ Way Future Project ] Where the people can move through a map that you can create live and show to others.
